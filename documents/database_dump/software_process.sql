In computer science, the analysis of algorithms is the process of finding the computational complexity of algorithms – the amount of time, storage, or other resources needed to execute them. Usually, this involves determining a function that relates the length of an algorithm\'s input to the number of steps it takes (its time complexity) or the number of storage locations it uses (its space complexity).', 'https://github.com/BoyuHuo/SESTOPIA/raw/master/documents/skill/Algorithm%20Designing%20and%20Complexity%20Analysis.pdf', '<ul><li>Used in Software Construction.</li><br> <li>Specifically, the skill has a major utilization in the <b>“Construction Design”</b> as well as “Coding” areas of Software Engineering.</li><br> <li>Also in the area of <b>“Computing Foundations”</b>, it is widely used in Problem Solving Techniques where appropriate design of algorithm and analysis of complexity is a critical feature.</li>');
